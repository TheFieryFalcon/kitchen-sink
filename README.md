# Kitchen-Sink Suggestions

Mods I will NOT include:

Gregtech

Reason: Completely overhauls the game, and is a complete pain in terms of compatibilities

Terrafirmacraft

Reason: Same as above, but is even more of a pain

Any mods that SIGNIFICANTLY increase loading time

Examples:

Decocraft

Any mods replaced by already existing mods

Common Examples:

AttributeFix
Fast Leaf Decay


Incompatible Mods:

WarpDrive \n
TechGuns \n
ReachFix \n
